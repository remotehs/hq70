## Useful information for the workshop on persistent.

Please go though the [official persistent introduction page](http://www.yesodweb.com/book/persistent) before the meetup.

The **code** directory contains a small example of using persisent.
Do `stack build`, followed by `stack exec code` to run the example. This will ensure you have a working persistent setup.

Install a sqlite program `sudo apt-get install sqlite3`.

Download the [Chinook database](https://chinookdatabase.codeplex.com/downloads/get/557773)

It would be great to also have the persistent code ready for quick reference.
`git clone https://github.com/yesodweb/persistent.git`
